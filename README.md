## The Problem Stemement:
The problem this tool attempts to solve is knowledge entropy. Creating, managing and maintaining current , relevant and up-to-date technical support documentation is elusive as the best of times. Especiallially amongst the SDLC community, because so much changes so often.  

## The Tech Stack

This tool is developed using RectJS on NodeJS and hosted on the AWS Aplify free-tier platform with AuthN provided by Google's Firebase.
